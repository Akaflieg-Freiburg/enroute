v2.3.0 Feature release
To improve readability, map contrast is increased and the app is less colorful than it used to be. There is now a dark mode, specifically designed for night flight.
There are many small additional improvements, in particular for flight route editing and flight route import. It is now possible to assign names to the waypoints of your flight route.
