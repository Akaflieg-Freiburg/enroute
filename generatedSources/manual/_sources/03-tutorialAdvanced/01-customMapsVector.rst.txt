Import Custom Vector Maps
=========================

**Enroute Flight Navigation** comes with a set of general-purpose base maps in
vector format, which have been carefully optimized for memory consumption and
display speed.  Still, there might be situations where a user might prefer
different maps: If you fly a rescue helicopter, you might prefer high-detail
vector maps for your particular region.

**Enroute Flight Navigation** is able to import MBTILES files containing vector
data.  Vector data must follow the standard `OpenMapTiles
<https://github.com/openmaptiles/openmaptiles>`_ schema.  Vector maps are
rendered in the same style that **Enroute Flight Navigation** uses for its own
maps.  It is possible to install vector maps along with the maps provided by
**Enroute Flight Navigation**.


Import Maps
-----------

Transfer the MBTILES file to your device and open the file on your device.  The
Section :ref:`importData` explains the process in detail.

To view and manage your maps, open the main menu and go to "Library/Maps and
Data".


MBTILES Map Data Sources
------------------------

The website `maptiler data <https://data.maptiler.com/downloads/planet/>`_
provides excellent vector maps that can be installed alongside the base maps
provided by **Enroute Flight Navigation**, in order to provide high-detail maps
for specific regions of interest.

Please let us know if you know of other map data sources!
