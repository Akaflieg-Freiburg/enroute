/*! \brief Traffic receiver
 *
 *  This class manages multiple TrafficDataSources. It combines the data
 *  streams, and passes data from the most relevant (if any) traffic data source
 *  on to the consumers of this class.
 *
 *  By default, it watches the following data channels:
 *
 *  - TCP connection to 192.168.1.1, port 2000
 *  - TCP connection to 192.168.10.1, port 2000
 *
 *  This class also acts as a PositionInfoSource, and passes position data (that
 *  some traffic receivers provide) on to the the consumers of this class.
 *
 *  Following the standards established by the app ForeFlight, this classEnroute
 *  broadcasts a UDP message on port 63093 every 5 seconds while the app is
 *  running in the foreground. This message allows devices to discover
 *  Enrouteâ€™s IP address, which can be used as the target of UDP unicast messages.
