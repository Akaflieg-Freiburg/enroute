Connect the SafeSky App
=======================

`SafeSky <https://www.safesky.app>`_ is an anti-collision app and a real-time
flight information service for all pilots flying any type of aircraft. The
commercial premium version of SafeSky integrates with **Enroute Flight
Navigation**. Once set up, the moving map of **Enroute Flight Navigation** will
show nearby traffic, similar to the map display when connected to a traffic
receiver.

Step 0: Before You Connect
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Traffic sharing is a premium feature of SafeSky. Before you connect, make sure
to have a valid premium subscription.


Step 1: Enable Traffic Sharing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the main menu of Safe Sky, choose the box "Traffic Sharing". The page
"Traffic Sharing" will open. 

- Choose the option "Enable traffic sharing"
  
- Touch the field below "Enable traffic sharing" to open the list of supported
  navigation apps. Choose "Enroute" from the list and touch the button "back" to
  close the list.

- Touch the button "back" to close page "Traffic sharing". Leave the main menu
  and return to the SafeSky main page.

That's it. As soon as you choose "TAKE OFF" in SafeSky to start a flight,
SafeSky will start a background process that shares traffic data with Enroute
Flight Navigation. 


Step 2: Check Connectivity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To check the SafeSky integration, choose "TAKE OFF" in SafeSky. Then, go to
**Enroute Flight Navigation**, open the main menu in **Enroute Flight
Navigation** and navigate to the "Information" menu.  If the entry "Traffic 
Receiver" is highlighted in green, then **Enroute Flight Navigation** has 
connected to the SafeSky app. Congratulations, you are done!
