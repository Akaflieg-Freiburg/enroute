 *
 * This pure virtual class is an interface to capabilities of mobile devices (e.g. vibration)
 * that need platform-specific code to operate.  The files PlatformAdaptor_XXX.(h|cpp) implement
 * a child class PlatformAdaptor that contains the actual implementation.
 *
 * Child classes need to implement all pure virtual functions, and need to provide the following additional functionality.
 *
 * - Child classes need to monitor the Wi-Fi network and emit the signal wifiConnected() whenever a new Wi-Fi connection becomes available. The
 *   app will then check if a traffic data receiver is active in the network.
 *
 * - If supported by the platform, child classes need to react to requests by the platform to open a file (e.g. a GeoJSON file containing a flight route).
 *   Once a request is received, the signal openFileRequest() must be emitted.
