<p>In response to user feedback, version ${PROJECT_VERSION} adds an option to
  disable the screensaver while the enroute app is running in the
  foreground. This option is enabled by default.</p>

<p>As a second new feature, the app will run in front of the screen lock.  It
  show immediately once you press the 'power on' button of your device, without
  the need to unlock the device with a code, pattern, password or
  fingerprint.</p>

<p>Fly safely and enjoy many happy landings!</p>

<p>-- Stefan Kebekus.</p>
