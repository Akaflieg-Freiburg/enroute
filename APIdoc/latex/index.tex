 {\bfseries{Enroute Flight Navigation}} is a fairly standard Qt application. The user interface is written in QML, the hard functionality is written in C++.

This document describes the C++ part of the program. The documentation is continuously generated from the master branch of the GIT repository.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{A. Moving map}{A. Moving map}}\label{index_autotoc_md1}
The moving map is a standard QML Map object that uses the {\bfseries{mapboxgl}} plugin. As mapboxgl expects the map data to come over the internet, there is a Geo\+Map\+Provider object that runs an internal http-\/server to provide the data.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{B. C++ classes exposed to QML}{B. C++ classes exposed to QML}}\label{index_autotoc_md2}
The main() function constructs a number of C++ objects and exposes them to QML.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{B.\+1 C++ classes providing core functionality}{B.\+1 C++ classes providing core functionality}}\label{index_autotoc_md3}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item An instance of the class Global, under the name "{}global"{}. This class allows access to other application-\/wide class instances. Eventually, all application-\/wide instances should be handled by this class.
\item Instances of the classes Geo\+Map\+Provider, under the name "{}geo\+Map\+Provider"{}. This classes allow access to the library of geographic maps, and provide the map data in formats suitable for use by QML.
\item An instance of the class Position\+Provider, under the name "{}position\+Provider"{}. This class contains the satellite navigaton functionality and is really a thin wrapper around QGeo\+Position\+Info\+Source, that provides data in formats suitable for aviation purposes.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item An instance of the class Library, under the name "{}library"{}. This class helps to maintain a library of flight routes.
\item Instances of the classes Aircraft, Flight\+Route and Wind, under the name "{}aircraft"{}, "{}flight\+Route"{} and "{}wind"{}. These classes are used for route and wind computation.
\item An instance of the class Clock, under the name "{}clock"{}. This class provides time information, computation and description.
\item An instance of the class Weather\+::\+Download\+Manager, under the name "{}weather\+Download\+Manager"{}. This class provides weather info.
