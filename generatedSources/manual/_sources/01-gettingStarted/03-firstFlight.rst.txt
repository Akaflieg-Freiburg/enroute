Before Your First Flight
========================

If you have followed the steps outlined in :ref:`secInstallation`, then you are
now ready to use **Enroute Flight Navigation**.  The user interface is designed
to be as intuitive as we could make it.  Still, we recommend that you take a
minute to make yourself familiar with the moving map display and with the basic
controls before you take the app on its first flight.  The section
:ref:`mainPage` covers the moving map in more detail.


The Moving Map
--------------

After startup, the app will show a moving map, similar in style to the standard
ICAO maps that most pilots know.  Use the standard gestures to zoom and pan the
map to your liking.  The figures :ref:`movingMapGround` and
:ref:`movingMapFlight` shows how the map will typically look.

Initially, your own position is shown as a blue circle (or gray if the system
has not yet acquired a valid position).  Once you are moving, your own position
is shown as a blue arrow shape.  The flight path vector shows the projected
track for the next five minutes, sized so that each of the black and white
segments corresponds to one minute.

.. note:: When you start the app for the first time, you will probably see a
   bright red aircraft symbol in the lower left corner of the map. This symbol
   indicates that the app is not connected to the traffic data receiver of your
   aircraft, so that traffic will not be shown on the moving map.  
   
   Once you are familiar with the app, please have a look at the Section
   :ref:`traffic` of this manual.


The Navigation Bar
------------------

The bottom of the display shows a little panel with the following information.

====== ==============
Code   Meaning
====== ==============
T.TALT True altitude (=geometric altitude) above sea level.
FL     Flight level.
GS     Ground speed.
TT     True track.
UTC    Current time.
====== ==============

The flight level is only available if your device is connected to a traffic
receiver (such as a PowerFLARM device) that reports the pressure altitude.
Flight level and current time are hidden if the display is not wide enough.

.. warning:: Vertical airspace boundaries are defined by pressure altitudes
   (with respect to QNH or standard pressure).  Depending on temperature and air
   density, the pressure altitude will differ from the true altitude that is
   shown by the app.  **Never use true altitude to judge vertical distances to
   airspaces.**


Interactive Controls
--------------------

In addition to the pan and pinch gestures, you can use the following buttons to
control the app.

===================================== ========
Symbol                                Function
===================================== ========
.. image:: ic_menu.png                Open main menu
.. image:: NorthArrow.png             Switch between display modes **north up** and **track up**.
.. image:: ic_my_location.png         Center map about own position.
.. image:: ic_add.png                 Zoom in
.. image:: ic_remove.png              Zoom out
.. image:: ic_airplanemode_active.png Warning when the app is not connected to a traffic data receiver.
===================================== ========



.. _firstFlightWaypointInfo:

Information About Airspaces, Airfields and Other Facilities
-----------------------------------------------------------

Double tap or tap-and-hold anywhere in the map to obtain information about the
airspace situation at that point.  If you double tap or tap-and-hold on an
airfield, navaid or reporting point, detailed information about the facility
will be shown.  The figure :ref:`wpInfo` shows how this will typically look.

The dialog uses the following abbreviations.

============= ================================
Abbreviations 
============= ================================
DIST          Distance to the waypoint
QUJ           True track to the waypoint
E             Minimal gliding ratio required to reach waypoint in 300 m AGL (disregarding terrain)
============= ================================


Go Flying!
----------

**Enroute Flight Navigation** is designed to be simple.  We think that you are
now ready to take the app on its first flight.  There are of course many more
things that you can do.  Play with the app and have a look at the next section
:ref:`sec-tutorialBasic`.
