Import Airspace Data
====================

**Enroute Flight Navigation** comes with a set of aviation maps that cover large
parts of the world and are updated frequently. In addition, users can import
airspace data in standard `OpenAir
<http://www.winpilot.com/usersguide/userairspace.asp>`_ format. Aviation clubs
and airfield operators use this feature to distribute OpenAir files to their
members to highlight noise-sensitive areas or airspaces available by local
agreement.

Airspaces defined in imported data will be shown in addition to the standard
aviation maps included with **Enroute Flight Navigation**.


Import Airspace Data
--------------------

Transfer the OpenAir file to your device and open the file on your device.  The
Section :ref:`importData` explains the process in detail.

To view and manage your maps, open the main menu and go to "Library/Maps and
Data".
