/*! \brief Base class for global singleton objects
 *
 * This is the base class for static instances of classes that are used
 * throughout the application.  The instances are constructed lazily at runtime,
 * whenever the appropriate methods are called.  They are children of the
 * QCoreApplication object and deleted along with this object.
 *
 * Although all relevant methods are static, it is possible to construct an
 * instance of this class, which allows to use this class from QML.
 *
 * The static methods return pointers to application-wide static objects. They
 * must only be called while a global QCoreApplication instance exists.  If
 * these conditions are satisfied, the pointers returned are guaranteed to be
 * valid.  The instances are owned by this class and must not be deleted. QML
 * ownership has been set to QQmlEngine::CppOwnership.
 *
 * Objects that inherit from this class MUST NOT call any of the static methods
 * from their constructors. Instead, the method deferredInitialization() can be
 * used, which is called immediately after the constructor returns.
 *
 * The methods in this class are reentrant, but not thread safe.
