Flight Planning Tools
=====================

While **Enroute Flight Navigation** offers essential flight planning
functionality, flights are best planned with full-featured software on a
big-screen computer.  The following software is compatible, tested, and known to
work well with **Enroute Flight Navigation**.


autorouter.aero
---------------

`autorouter <autorouter.aero>`_ is a free online flight planning tool. While
primarily aimed at IFR flights, it is popular with VFR pilots because it offers
convenient briefing packages, including NOTAM, weather, and airport plates. The
autorouter website also offers comprehensive flight plan management, an
interface to Eurocontrol services, and a messenger bot that can be used to
manage flight plans and access up-to-date airspace information/

The autorouter website is able to export flight routes in GPX format, which can
be read by **Enroute Flight Navigation**.  

- Open the website `autorouter.aero <autorouter.aero>`_ on the device that runs
  **Enroute Flight Navigation**.  Then log in.

- On the main page, open the tab 'Routes'. You will be presented with a list of
  routes that you have prepared.

- Choose the route that you would like to import into **Enroute Flight
  Navigation** and click on the button "View", which is found at the bottom of
  the list.

- After parsing the route for a few seconds, you are presented with a list of
  tabs. The tab "Route details" is already open.  Open the tab "Briefing
  information".

- Open the item "Choose the desired information" and select "GPX (Google Earth,
  EasyVFR)" from the drop-down menu.

- Click on "Download"

- The next step depends on the operating system of the device that runs
  **Enroute Flight Navigation**.

  - On Android or iOS, open the file on your device. The Section
    :ref:`importData` explains the process in detail.

  - On Linux/Desktop, use the file manager to drag-and-drop the GPX file into
    the window of **Enroute Flight Navigation**.

- A dialog window will open. **Enroute Flight Navigation** needs to know if the
  GPX file contains a flight route or a list of waypoints that you wish to
  import into the waypoint library.  Choose the button "Route".


FL95.de
-------

`FL95.de <fl95.de>`_ is a free online flight planning website popular in Germany
and surrounding countries.  It is able to export flight routes in GPX format,
which can be read by **Enroute Flight Navigation**.  

Since `FL95.de <fl95.de>`_ is not designed for the small screens of mobile
devices, we recommend using it on a desktop or laptop computer.  Proceed as
follows.

- On a desktop or laptop computer, open the website `FL95.de <fl95.de>`_ in your
  web browser.

- Use the website to plan a flight.

- Once done, open the tab "Laden Speichern Drucken"

- At "GPS-Export", choose "Dateiformat: GPX" and click on "Datei erzeugen". 

- `FL95.de <fl95.de>`_ will generate a file (typically called
  "FL95_EDTF_nach_EDTF.gpx") that will be downloaded via your web browser.  Most
  browsers store the file in the "Download" folder of your home directory.

- The next step depends on the operating system of the device that runs
  **Enroute Flight Navigation**.

  - On Android or iOS, transfer the GPX file to your device and open the file on
    your device. The Section :ref:`importData` explains the process in detail.

  - On Linux/Desktop, transfer the GPX file to your device and use the file
    manager to drag-and-drop it into the window of **Enroute Flight
    Navigation**.

- A dialog window will open. **Enroute Flight Navigation** needs to know if the
  GPX file contains a flight route or a list of waypoints that you wish to
  import into the waypoint library.  Choose the button "Route".

The `manual of FL95.de <https://fl95.de/help/help.php?p=io>`_ contains more
