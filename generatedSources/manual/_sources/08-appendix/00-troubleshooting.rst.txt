Known Issues and Troubleshooting
================================


Android
-------

**Enroute Flight Navigation** runs on a huge variety of Android platforms; at
the time of writing, Google Play lists over 13,000 different device models. The
developers cannot possibly test the software on every single device and ask for
your understanding that they cannot provide support for specific models.


Graphic Errors
..............

A very small number of users reported broken graphic and flickering that
rendered **Enroute Flight Navigation** unusable on their devices. The cause of
the problem is unknown because the developers could not reproduce the issue on
any of their devices. 

We have obtained reports that deleting the cache of the app solves the issue.
For that, open the Android Settings and navigate to "Apps / Enroute Flight
Navigation / Storage and cache / Clear Cache".


Resuming from Hibernation
.........................

Sporadically, **Enroute Flight Navigation** fails to start after being minimized
for a certain period. The app hangs on the splash screen.  As a workaround,
terminate the app by swiping its window off the screen and restart it.
