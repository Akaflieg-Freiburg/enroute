/*! \brief Interface to platform-specific capabilities of mobile devices
 *
 * This class is an interface to capabilities of mobile devices (e.g. vibration)
 * that need platform-specific code to operate.
 *
 * This class also receives platform-specific requests to open files and exposes
 * these requests to C++ and QML via the signal openFileRequest().  The signal
 * openFileRequest() is however only emitted after the method
 * startReceiveOpenFileRequests() has been called, requests that come in earlier
 * will be put on hold.  This allows apps to set up their GUI before processing
 * file open requests (that might need user interaction).
