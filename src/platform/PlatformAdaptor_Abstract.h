/*! \brief Interface to platform-specific functionality
 *
 * This pure virtual class is an interface to capabilities of mobile devices
 * (e.g. vibration) that need platform-specific code to operate.  The files
 * PlatformAdaptor_XXX.(h|cpp) implement a child class PlatformAdaptor that
 * contains the actual implementation.
 *
 * Child classes need to implement all pure virtual functions, and need to
 * provide the following additional functionality.
 *
 * - Child classes need to monitor the Wi-Fi network and emit the signal
 *   wifiConnected() whenever a new Wi-Fi connection becomes available. The app
 *   will then check if a traffic data receiver is active in the network.
 *
 * - If supported by the platform, child classes need to react to requests by
 *   the platform to open a file (e.g. a GeoJSON file containing a flight
 *   route). Once a request is received, the method processFileRequest() should
 *   be called.
