# Frequently asked questions

## There are no maps for my country. Can you please add them.

Maybe.  Please understand that we program the app in our spare time, as a
service to the community.  Sadly, I should point us that sending us impolite
demands or giving us one-star-ratings at Google Play is not likely to give the
result that you desire.

We receive our aviation data from [openAIP](openaip.net).  This is a
not-for-profit organisation where volunteers compile aviation data for many
countries.  If openAIP covers your country, we might be able to generate maps
for it.  First, however, we need to be reasonably sure that the openAIP data is
accurate and complete.  Please have a look at the [openAIP
maps](http://maps.openaip.net) and compare the display with an official aviation
map of your country.  Are the airfields there? Are runway lengths/orientations
and frequencies correct?  Are NavAids correctly displayed, with correct codes
and frequenciest?  And what about airspaces?

If you are convinced that the data is good enough to be added, you can request
to add the country by sending us an e-mail.  Please tell us who you are, where
you fly and how you convinced yourself that the data is good.  If you find that
the data is not good enough, you are welcome to join the openAIP project and
help to improve the data.
