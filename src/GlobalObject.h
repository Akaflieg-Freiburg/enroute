/*! \brief GlobalObject instance storage
 *
 * This class manages a collection of static instances of classes that are used
 * throughout the application.  The instances are constructed lazily at runtime,
 * whenever the appropriate methods are called.  They are children of the GlobalObject
 * QCoreApplication object and deleted along with this object.
 *
 * Although all relevant methods are static, it is possible to construct an
 * instance of this class, which allows to use this class from QML.
 *
 * The static methods return pointers to application-wide static objects. These
 * pointer is guaranteed to be valid.  The instances are owned by this class and
 * must not be deleted. QML ownership has been set to QQmlEngine::CppOwnership.
 *
 * @note This method must only be called while a GlobalObject QCoreApplication exists.
 * If GlobalObject manages an instance of your class, then none of the static methods
 * must not be called in the constructor of your class, or else an inite loop
 * may result.
 *
 * The methods in this class are reentrant, but not thread safe.
