Find Nearby Waypoints
=====================

If the weather turns bad, **Enroute Flight Navigation** can help you find the
best place to land.  Open the main menu and choose the item "Nearby waypoints".
You will be presented with a list of the closest aerodromes, together with
distances and directions.  Click on any item to open a dialog with detailed
information, including lists of runways and communications frequencies.  The
dialog has a button "Direct" the replaces the current route with a route that
brings you directly to the aerodrome.
