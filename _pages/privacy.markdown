- The app contains third-party software components, including map rendering software from [MapBox, Inc.](https://www.mapbox.com/)  While we have checked that no data is collected by these components, there is a chance that we overlooked something.

- The app accesses the internet, for instance to download maps and to check for updates. The internet sites where the data resides may not be under our control and may keep access logs.
