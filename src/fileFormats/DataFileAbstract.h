 *
 *  This is an abstract base class for all classes that read data files, such as
 *  CUP, GeoJSON, GeoTIFF, â€¦. Implementations should adhere to the following
 *  conventions:
 *
 *  - The constructor takes a file name as an argument and reads the file, which
 *    might be quite expensive.
 *
 *  - There is a static method 'mimeTypes' that describes the mime types of the
 *    files that can be opened with this class.

     *  lightweight.

     *
