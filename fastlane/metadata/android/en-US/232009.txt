### Fixed
- The list of available maps was downloaded, but not processed on first startup.
  As a result, new users were shown a message that maps are not available for
  their location. (#485)

- Android users experienced very infrequent, but annoying ANRs.

### Changed
- Show list of all traffic on the page "Information/Traffic Data Receiver".
  Adjust the manual accordingly.
