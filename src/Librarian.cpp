Please have a look at the <a href="http://maps.openaip.net">openAIP maps</a> and compare the display with an official aviation map of your country. Are the airfields there? Are runway lengths/orientations and frequencies correct? Are NavAids correctly displayed, with correct codes and frequencies? And what about airspaces?</p>

<p>If you are convinced that the data is good enough to be added, you can request to add the country. Please go to <a href="https://github.com/Akaflieg-Freiburg/enrouteServer/issues">this web site</a> and open an 'issue' with your request. Please tell us who you are, where you fly and how you convinced yourself that the data is good. If you find that the data is not good enough, you are welcome to join the openAIP project and help to improve the data.</p>
