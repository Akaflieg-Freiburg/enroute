Sense and Avoid
###############

Midair collisions are a major reason for loss of lives in general aviation.
While anti-collision systems are still not mandatory in several European
countries, it is clear that no responsible pilot will fly without such a system.
**Enroute Flight Navigation** can connect to your aircraft's traffic receiver
and show nearby traffic in the moving map.

To check the connection to your traffic data receiver anytime, open the main
menu and choose :ref:`InfoTrafficPage`.
