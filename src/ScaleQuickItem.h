/*! \brief QML Class implementing a scale for a Map

  This class implements a QML item that draws a scale, to be added to a map.  To
  work, the property pixelPer10km needs to be set, according to the scale of the
  map.  To use this class, export it to QML, add it to your view and make sure
  that the property pixelPer10km get set accordingly.

  The methods of this class are re-entrant, but not thread safe.
