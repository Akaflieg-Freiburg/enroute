Our maps available for offline use, so that the app does not require any internet connection in flight.

## Base maps

Our base maps are edited versions of maps kindly provided by [Klokan Technologies](https://www.klokantech.com/) through the [OpenMapTiles](https://openmaptiles.org) project.


## Aeronautical maps

Our free aeronautical maps are compiled from databases provided by the [openAIP](http://openaip.net) and the [open flightmaps](https://www.openflightmaps.org/) projects. While openAIP covers most of the world, the open flightmaps cover fewer countries but contain more detailed information. The maps receive near-weekly updates.

### Class 1 and Class 2 maps

For simplicity, our maps are divided in "Class 1" and "Class 2".

- Class 1 maps are compiled from [openAIP](http://openaip.net) and [open flightmaps](https://www.openflightmaps.org/) data. These maps contain complete information about airspaces, airfields and navaids.  In addition, the maps contain (mandatory) reporting points. Some of our tier 1 maps also show traffic circuits and flight procedures for control zones.

- Class 2 maps are compiled from [openAIP](http://openaip.net) data only. They contain complete information about airspaces, airfields and navaids.
