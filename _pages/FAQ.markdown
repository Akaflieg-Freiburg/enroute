# Frequently asked questions

## There are no maps for my country. Can you please add them?

Maybe.  Please understand that we program this free app in our spare time, as a
service to the community.  Sadly, I should point us that sending us impolite
demands is not likely to give the result that you desire.

We receive our aviation data from [openAIP](openaip.net).  This is a
not-for-profit organization where volunteers compile aviation data for many
countries.  If openAIP covers your country, we might be able to generate maps
for it.  First, however, we need to be reasonably sure that the openAIP data is
accurate and complete.  Please have a look at the [openAIP
maps](http://maps.openaip.net) and compare the display with an official aviation
map of your country.  Are the airfields there? Are runway lengths/orientations
and frequencies correct?  Are navaids correctly displayed, with correct codes
and frequencies?  And what about airspaces?

If you are convinced that the data is good enough to be added, you can request
to add the country. Please go to [this
website](https://github.com/Akaflieg-Freiburg/enrouteServer/issues) and open an
'issue' with your request.  Please tell us who you are, where you fly and how
you convinced yourself that the data is good.  If you find that the data is not
good enough, you are welcome to join the openAIP project and help to improve the
data.


## What is the minimum Android version?

At present **Enroute Flight Navigation** requires Android 6.0 or later.  We ask
for your understanding that we cannot support older devices, as this would
require manpower that we simply do not have.
