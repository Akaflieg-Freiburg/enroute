<h3>Participate in the development</h3>

<p>We have great plans for <strong>Enroute Flight
Navigation</strong>, check our
<a href='https://github.com/Akaflieg-Freiburg/enroute/projects'>project
list at GitHub</a> to see what's coming.</p>

<h3>Translate</h3>

<p>If know how to use the GIT version control system and if
you would like to translate the app to your native
language, we would like to hear from you. Programming
experience is not necessary, but good computer skills are
required.</p>

<h3>Join the development</h3>

<p>If you are fluent in C++ and if you would like to help
with the programming, please get in touch with us by
opening a GitHub issue. We are also struggling with power
management on Android and would be grateful for any help
that we could get.</p>

<h3>Port to iOS</h3>

<p>This app should run fine on Apple devices. If you would
like to port the app to iOS and if you have development
experience with C++/Qt programming and with Apple systems,
please get in touch with us by opening a GitHub issue.</p>
