Mapping Tools
=============

**Enroute Flight Navigation** is able to import location information ("Map Pins") from
popular mapping tools. This feature has been requested by helicopter pilots working in medical
evacuation, rescue and police operations.  It can also be used by general aviation pilots
who would like to add landmarks ("Hohenzollern Castle") to their flight routes or to their
waypoint library.

.. note:: 
  The functionality described here is only available in version 2.30.9 or later. At the time 
  of writing, the functionality is only available on the Android and Linux/Desktop
  platforms.

  Maps" and "Google Maps Go" is no longer supported. The app "HERE WeGo" has technical 
  issues. As an alternative, use the online version in your browser of consider the app
