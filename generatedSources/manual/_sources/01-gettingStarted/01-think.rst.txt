Think Before You Fly
====================

**Enroute Flight Navigation** is a free software product that has been published
in the hope that it might be useful as an aid to prudent navigation.  It comes
with no guarantees.  It may not work as expected.  Data shown to you might be
wrong.  Your hardware may fail.

This app is no substitute for proper flight preparation or good pilotage.  Any
information **must always** be validated using an official navigation and
airspace data source.

.. warning:: Always use official flight navigation data for flight preparation
    and navigate by officially authorized means. The use of non-certified
    navigation devices and software like **Enroute Flight Navigation** as a
    primary source of navigation may cause accidents leading to loss of lives.

We do not believe that the use of **Enroute Flight Navigation** fulfills the
requirement of the EU Regulation `No 923/2012:SERA.2010
<https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2012:281:0001:0066:EN:PDF>`_

  Before beginning a flight, the pilot-in-command of an aircraft shall become
  familiar with all available information appropriate to the intended operation.


To put it simply: relying on **Enroute Flight Navigation** as a primary means of
navigation is most likely illegal in your jurisdiction.  It is most certainly
stupid and potentially suicidal.



Software Limitations
--------------------

**Enroute Flight Navigation** is not an officially approved flight navigation
software.  It is not officially approved or certified in any way.  The software
comes with no guarantee and might contain bugs.



Navigational Data and Aviation Data
-----------------------------------

Navigational-- and aviation data, including airspace and airfield information,
are provided "as is" and without any guarantee, official validation,
certification or warranty.  The data does not come from official sources.  It
might be incomplete, outdated or otherwise incorrect.


Operating System Limitations
----------------------------

We expect that most users will run the software on mobile phones or tablet
computers running the Android or iOS operating system.  Neither Android nor iOS
is officially approved or certified for aviation.  While we expect that the app
will run fine for the vast majority of users, please keep the following in mind.

* The operating system can decide at any time to terminate **Enroute Flight
  Navigation** or to slow it down to clear resources for other apps.

* Other apps might interfere with the operation of **Enroute Flight
  Navigation**.

* Many hardware vendors equip their Android devices with "battery saving apps"
  that randomly kill long-running processes. These apps cannot be uninstalled by
  the users, do not comply with Android standards and are often extremely buggy.
  At times, users can manually exempt apps from "battery saving mode", but the
  settings are usually lost on system updates.  See the website `Don't kill my
  app <https://dontkillmyapp.com>`_ for more information.


Hardware Limitations
--------------------

**Enroute Flight Navigation** runs on a variety of hardware platforms, but we
expect that most users will run the software on mobile phones, tablet computers
and comparable consumer electronic devices that are not certified to meet
aviation standards.  Keep the following in mind.

* Your device might not be designed to operate continuously for extended periods
  of time, in particular if the display is on.

* Your device can overheat. Batteries can catch fire.

* Battery capacity is limited.  Even if your device is connected to power via a
  USB cable, the display and/or CPU might use more energy than USB can deliver.
