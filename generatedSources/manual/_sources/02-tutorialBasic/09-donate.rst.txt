**Enroute Flight Navigation** is a non-commercial project of Akaflieg Freiburg,
supported by the University of Freiburg. Flight enthusiasts have written the app
in their spare time as a service to the community. The developers do not take
donations.

If you appreciate the app, please consider donating to Akaflieg Freiburg, a
tax-privileged, not-for-profit flight club of public utility in Freiburg,
Germany. The club will use your donation to promote aviation as a recreational
sport; this includes funding the further development of **Enroute Flight
Navigation** and its infrastructure. Donations to Akaflieg Freiburg are
tax-deductible in Germany. Contact `info@akaflieg-freiburg.de
