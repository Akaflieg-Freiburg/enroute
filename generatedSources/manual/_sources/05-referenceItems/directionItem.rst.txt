points include waypoints in your flight route or METAR/TAF stations.  If
positioning data is available, every item prominently display a brief direction
summary with the following data.

- **DIST:** Distance from your current position to the geographic point, shown
  in the unit of measurement set in your aircraft preferences.  

- **QUJ:** True course from your current position to the geographic point.

- **E:** Gliding ratio required to reach the geographic for your current
  position by straight flight, arriving in 300 m AGL. If the gliding ratio is
  negative or extremely high, the symbol 'âˆž' is shown.

.. warning::
  
  The gliding ratio is computed without regard for terrain. There might be a
  mountain in your way!
