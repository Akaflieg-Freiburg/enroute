# Frequently asked questions

## Can you add maps for country xx

Maybe.  We receive our aviation data from [openAIP](openaip.net).  This is a
not-for-profit organisation where volunteers compile aviation data for many
countries.  Before we generate maps for a country, we need to be reasonably sure
that the openAIP data is accurate and complete.  Please have a look at the
[openAIP maps](http://maps.openaip.net) and compare the display with an official
aviation map of your country.  Are the airfields there? Are runway
lengths/orientations and frequencies correct?  Are NavAids correctly displayed,
with correct codes and frequenciest?  And what about airspaces?

If you are convinced that the data is good enough to be added, you can request
to add the country by sending us a polite e-mail.  Please tell us who you are,
where you fly and how you convinced yourself that the data is good.  If you find
that the data is not good enough, you are welcome to join the openAIP project
and help to improve the data.

Please understand that we program the app in our spare time, that non of us
flies in your country.  We donate our free time as a service to the community.
Sadly, I should point us that sending us impolite requests in hard-to-understand
english or giving us one-star-ratings at Google Play is not likely to give the
result that you desire.
