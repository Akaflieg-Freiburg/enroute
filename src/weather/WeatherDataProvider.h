/*! \brief WeatherDataProvider, weather service manager
 *
 * This class retrieves METAR/TAF weather reports from the "Aviation Weather
 * Center" at aviationweather.com, for all weather stations that are within 75nm
 * from the last-known user position or current route.  The reports can then be
 * accessed via the property "weatherStations" and the method
 * findWeatherStation.  The WeatherDataProvider class honors
 * GlobalSettings::acceptedWeatherTerms() and will initiate a download only if
 * the user agreed to the privacy warning.
 *
 * Once constructed, the WeatherDataProvider class will regularly perform background
 * updates to retrieve up-to-date information. It will update the list of known
 * weather stations and also the METAR/TAF reports for the weather stations.
 * The class checks regularly for outdated METAR and TAF reports and deletes
 * them automatically, along with those WeatherStations that no longer contain
 * any report.
 *
 * In order to avoid loss of data when the app is accidently closed in-flight,
 * the class stores all weather data at destruction and at regular intervals,
 * and reads the data back in on construction.
 *
 * This class also contains a number or convenience methods and properties
 * pertaining to sunrise/sunset
