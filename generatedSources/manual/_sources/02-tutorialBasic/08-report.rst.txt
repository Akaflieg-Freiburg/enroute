Report Issues or Make a Suggestion
==================================

We aim to provide high-quality software. Fixing errors is therefore always our
first priority. We are grateful for every report that we get, and we would also
like to hear your suggestions for improvement.

To make sure that your report reaches the correct person, please proceed as
follows.

- Open the main menu and go to "Bug report". 
- The page "Bug report" will open.
- Choose the part of our software that your would like to report.
- At the end, you will be presented with contact information and a short
  explanation how the error is best reported.

.. note:: Please keep in mind that **Enroute Flight Navigation** is developed 
   by a very small team of programmers in their spare time.  While we try to 
   answer every request, we often receive more mail than we can handle.  
   Please be patient!
