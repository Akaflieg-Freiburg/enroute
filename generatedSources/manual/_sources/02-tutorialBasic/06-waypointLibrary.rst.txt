Manage a Waypoint Library
=========================


What to Expect
--------------

**Enroute Flight Navigation** allows you to build a small library of waypoints
that can be used in flight routes and shared with others. For the typical user,
the library might contain a list of touristic landmarks ("Hohenzollern Castle"),
or perhaps a list of emergency landing fields. The waypoints from the library
are shown in the moving map. 

.. note:: 
  The waypoint library has been designed with small libraries in mind. If you 
  import files containing thousands of waypoints, you might find that the moving
  map of **Enroute Flight Navigation** slows down considerably.


Add Waypoints to the Library
----------------------------

There are two ways to add waypoints to the library.

- Select points from the moving map
- Import waypoint files


Option 1: Select Points from the Moving Map
...........................................

To add a waypoint from the moving map, tap-and-hold onto the moving map, so that
the waypoint description dialog opens.  In that dialog, click on "Library/Addâ€¦"
Before saving, it is possible to assign a name and to edit the coordinates of
the waypoint.

.. note:: 
  To avoid data duplication, it is not possible to add airfields, navaids or 
  reporting points to the waypoint library. If you tap-and-hold onto an 
  airfield, you will find that the Item "Library" is disabled in the waypoint
  description dialog.


Option 2: Import Waypoint Files
...............................

**Enroute Flight Navigation** is able to import waypoints from files in CUP,
GeoJSON or GPX format. Transfer the file to your device (using Bluetooth file
transfer, Google Drive, sending yourself an e-mail, or any other communication
channel) and open the file on your device. The Section :ref:`importData`
explains the process in detail.
