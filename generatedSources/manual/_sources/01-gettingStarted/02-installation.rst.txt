Installation and Setup
======================

Hardware Considerations
-----------------------

**Enroute Flight Navigation** is designed to run on mobile devices.  During
flight, it relies on the device's built-in SatNav receiver as a primary source
for position information.  If no SatNav receiver is available, **Enroute Flight
Navigation** can use your aircraft's traffic data receiver as a fallback source.

.. note:: 
  At the time of writing, Apple iPad devices contain a SatNav receiver only if a
  cell phone modem is also installed.  Unless your aircraft is equipped with a 
  traffic data receiver that broadcasts position information, iPad devices without
  SatNav receiver cannot be used for flight navigation.
