### Fixed
- METAR report is are now showing for airfields not close to current position or
  flight route. (#473)

### Added
- For better user experience on desktop-platforms, several list views now
  support key navigation. This feature is only available on Linux and macOS.

- Updated the privacy statement. The server 'enroute-data' now maintains its own
  METAR/TAF database and no longer forwards requests to the aviation weather
  center.
