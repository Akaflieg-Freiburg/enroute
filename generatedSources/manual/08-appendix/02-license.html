 Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;https://fsf.org/&gt;

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
 document, but changing it is not allowed.

 Preamble

   The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and
   other kinds of works.

   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to
   take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU
   General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and
   change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for
   all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public
   License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released
   this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
   General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom
   to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish),
   that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can
   change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you
   know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these
   rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain
   responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify
   it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or
   for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you
   received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
   code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

   Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1)
   assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you
   legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

   For the developers&#39; and authors&#39; protection, the GPL clearly explains that
   there is no warranty for this free software. For both users&#39; and authors&#39;
   sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that
   their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous
   versions.

   Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified
   versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do
   so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users&#39;
   freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs
   in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it
   is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to
   prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise
   substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to
   those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the
   freedom of users.

   Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States
   should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on
   general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the
   special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it
   effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents
   cannot be used to render the program non-free.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
   follow.

 TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 0. Definitions.

   “This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

   “Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
   works, such as semiconductor masks.

   “The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
   License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients”
   may be individuals or organizations.

   To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a
   fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact
   copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work
   or a work “based on” the earlier work.

   A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the
   Program.

   To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission,
   would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under
   applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a
   private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without
   modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other
   activities as well.

   To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties
   to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer
   network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

   An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the
   extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature
   that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user
   that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties
   are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and
   how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user
   commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this
   criterion.

 1. Source Code.

   The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
   modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.

   A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official
   standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
   interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is
   widely used among developers working in that language.

   The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than
   the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a
   Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b)
   serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to
   implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to
   the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means
   a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the
   specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a
   compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run
   it.

   The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the
   source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run
   the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those
   activities. However, it does not include the work&#39;s System Libraries, or
   general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used
   unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the
   work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files
   associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared
   libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically
   designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow
   between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate
   automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

 2. Basic Permissions.

   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright
   on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are
   met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the
   unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by
   this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered
   work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent,
   as provided by copyright law.

   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,
   without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You
   may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make
   modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for
   running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License
   in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus
   making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your
   behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from
   making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship
   with you.

   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the
   conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it
   unnecessary.

 3. Protecting Users&#39; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure
   under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO
   copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or
   restricting circumvention of such measures.

   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
   circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is
   effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered
   work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of
   the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&#39;s users, your or third
   parties&#39; legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you receive
   it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish
   on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices
   stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with
   section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any
   warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the
   Program.

   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you
   may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce
   it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section
   4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

   a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and
      giving a relevant date.

   b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under
      this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement
      modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.

   c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to
      anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore
      apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole
      of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This
      License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it
      does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

   d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
      Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
      interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need
      not make them do so.

   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works,
   which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are
   not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of
   a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the
   compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or
   legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users beyond what the individual works
   permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this
   License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
   sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
   Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

   a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including
      a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source
      fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software
      interchange.

   b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including
      a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid
      for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts
      or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses
      the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the
      software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable
      physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
      more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of
      source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network
      server at no charge.

   c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written
      offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed
      only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the
      object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.

   d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis
      or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source
      in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not
      require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object
      code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the
      Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a
      third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you
      maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find
      the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the
      Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available
      for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

   e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you
      inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the
      work are being offered to the general public at no charge under
      subsection 6d.

   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from
   the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in
   conveying the object code work.

   A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any
   tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or
   household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into
   a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful
   cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product
   received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common
   use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular
   user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or
   is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless
   of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or
   non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of
   use of the product.

   “Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures,
   authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute
   modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified
   version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure
   that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case
   prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.

   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
   specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of
   a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product
   is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term
   (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding
   Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation
   Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any
   third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User
   Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
   requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for
   a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User
   Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may
   be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the
   operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for
   communication across the network.

   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in
   accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented
   (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form),
   and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or
   copying.

 7. Additional Terms.

    “Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this
    License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional
    permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as
    though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are
    valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of
    the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but
    the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the
    additional permissions.

    When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any
    additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional
    permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases
    when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on
    material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give
    appropriate copyright permission.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add
    to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that
    material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of
       sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author
       attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices
       displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
       requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
       reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors
       of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade
       names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by
       anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with
       contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability
       that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors
       and authors.

    All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further
    restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you
    received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
    governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction,
    you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further
    restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you
    may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license
    document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such
    relicensing or conveying.

    If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must
    place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms
    that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the
    applicable terms.

    Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form
    of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above
    requirements apply either way.

 8. Termination.

    You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided
    under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is
    void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License
    (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section
    11).

    However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from
    a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and
    until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license,
    and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the
    violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

    Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
    permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some
    reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of
    violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and
    you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

    Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
    licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this
    License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
    reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
    material under section 10.

 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

    You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a
    copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring
    solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a
    copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this
    License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered
    work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this
    License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you
    indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

    Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a
    license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that
    work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing
    compliance by third parties with this License.

    An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an
    organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
    organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work
    results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who
    receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the
    party&#39;s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous
    paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the
    work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get
    it with reasonable efforts.

    You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights
    granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a
    license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under
    this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim
    or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed
    by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or
    any portion of it.

 11. Patents.

    A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License
    of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus
    licensed is called the contributor&#39;s “contributor version”.

    A contributor&#39;s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or
    controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter
    acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this
    License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not
    include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further
    modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition,
    “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner
    consistent with the requirements of this License.

    Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
    license under the contributor&#39;s essential patent claims, to make, use,
    sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the
    contents of its contributor version.

    In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express
    agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such
    as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for
    patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to
    make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the
    party.

    If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and
    the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy,
    free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly
    available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must
    either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2)
    arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this
    particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the
    requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream
    recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but
    for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or
    your recipient&#39;s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one
    or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to
    believe are valid.

    If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement,
    you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and
    grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work
    authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the
    covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended
    to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

    A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the
    scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the
    non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted
    under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to
    an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing
    software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the
    extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third
    party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from
    you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the
    covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b)
    primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
    contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that
    patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

    Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any
    implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be
    available to you under applicable patent law.

 12. No Surrender of Others&#39; Freedom.

   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
   excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a
   covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
   License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
   not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
   to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the
   Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License
   would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to
   link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the
   GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey
   the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the
   part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU
   Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a
   network will apply to the combination as such.

 14. Revised Versions of this License.

   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
   GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
   similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
   address new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
   specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License
   “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the
   terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version
   published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a
   version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version
   ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of
   the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&#39;s public statement of
   acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version
   for the Program.

   Later license versions may give you additional or different
   permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or
   copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
   LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
   OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
   EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
   WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
   ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
   YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
   NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

 16. Limitation of Liability.

   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
   ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE
   PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
   GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE
   OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA
   OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
   PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
   EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
   SUCH DAMAGES.

 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above
   cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing
   courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute
   waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a
   warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in
   return for a fee.
