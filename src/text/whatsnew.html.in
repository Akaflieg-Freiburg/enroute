<p>Compared to earlier versions of the app, version ${PROJECT_VERSION} is more
  responsive when downloading or updating maps on low-end devices.</p>

<p>In response to user feedback, the moving map display has been changed a
  little.  Flight routes will now always be shown, and are no longer hidden at
  high zoom values.</p>

<p>Fly safely and enjoy many happy landings!</p>

<p>-- Stefan Kebekus.</p>
